Half-baked projects / random things I had a blast with

(Don't expect the documentation in here to be fantastic lol)

## Crawl the UCLA dining hall nutritional information
Counting calories is hard enough as it is, how about we set a cron task every morning at 2 a.m. to run a crawler to get the nutritional information from http://menu.dining.ucla.edu then import it into certain fitness apps?

Crawler returns a bunch of JSON objects

## Crawl linkedin
This was fun b/c I had to find a way to get around LI's rate limiting / bot detection
